## 📘 What I’ve Learned So Far

As I explore React step-by-step, here are the core concepts I’ve already covered:

- ✅ **Components & Props** – Breaking UI into reusable parts  
- ✅ **State & Lifecycle** – Managing data & component behavior  
- ✅ **Conditional Rendering** – Showing content dynamically  
- ✅ **Handling Events** – Adding interactivity with clicks, inputs, etc.  
- 🔄 **React Hooks** – *(In Progress)* – Starting with `useState` & `useEffect`  
- 🧭 **React Router** – *(Coming Soon)* – For navigating multiple pages  
- 🧠 **Context API & Redux** – *(Planned)* – For global state management
